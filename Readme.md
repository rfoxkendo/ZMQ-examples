This repository are simple examples for the ZMQ communications
system as well as software to obtain timings for it.

### The programs are:

*  pair.cpp - Illlustrates the pair pattern.  Single parameter:  An end point URI.

Note all programs are threaded so that the communicating partners are threads within the program.

See 

[The performance directory](performance/Readme.md) for
information about the timings programs.
